R is a bit lacking in the area of image processing, where Matlab is still king. Imager aims to make image processing work in R easier. It is based on [CImg](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/), a C++ library by David Tschumperlé. CImg provides an easy-to-use and consistent API for image processing, which imager largely replicates. CImg supports images in up to four dimensions, which makes it suitable for basic video processing/hyperspectral imaging as well. 

## Features

At this stage imager covers:

- loading and saving images in various formats
- displaying and plotting images
- working with pixel neighbourhoods 
- interpolation, resizing, warping
- filtering and FFTs
- morphological operations 

## Installing the package

Imager is now on CRAN, so

	install.packages("imager")

should to the trick. If you prefer the latest development version, see our [Github page](https://www.github.com/dahtah/imager). 

## Dependencies

You'll also need [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php) and [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html) if you want to work with videos, or import and save images in formats other than PNG and JPEG. On Linux these should be available from standard repositories (ie. "sudo apt-get install ffmpeg" should work). On OS X they are available via brew: "brew install imagemagick ffmpeg". 

## Getting started 

There's a tutorial included in the package:  hit

	vignette("gettingstarted",package="imager")

or [click here](gettingstarted.html).

The tutorial covers basic image manipulation, plotting use base graphics and ggplot2, getting image data in and out, and an example of multiscale blob detection.

## Documentation

Most functions are described in the general package [documentation](imager.html).

There's also a number of tutorials and case studies:

- a [tutorial](image_stats.html) on natural image statistics using imager
- another (incomplete) tutorial on [morphology and detrending](morphology.html)
- a [tutorial](foreground_background.html) on [foreground/background segmentation](http://opensource.graphics/how-to-code-a-nice-user-guided-foreground-extraction-algorithm/)
- information on [accessing the CImg API using Rcpp](cpp_api.html)
- a [list of all functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/imager.pdf) with examples

You might find [CImg](http://cimg.eu/)'s doc useful as well. 

Bugs and miscellaneous problems can be reported on the [issues page](https://github.com/dahtah/imager/issues) on Github.
