R is a bit lacking in the area of image processing, where Matlab is still king. Imager aims to make image processing work in R easier. It is based on [CImg](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/), a C++ library by David Tschumperlé. CImg provides an easy-to-use and consistent API for image processing, which imager largely replicates. CImg supports images in up to four dimensions, which makes it suitable for basic video processing/hyperspectral imaging as well. 

## Features

At this stage imager covers:

- loading and saving images in various formats
- displaying and plotting images
- working with pixel neighbourhoods 
- interpolation, resizing, warping
- filtering and FFTs
- morphological operations 

## How to install

### The package

Install the devtools package if you haven't already. Then run:

	library(devtools)
	install_github("dahtah/imager")

So far the package is only available as source code, so you'll need a functional R build environment (Rtools on Windows, XCode on OS X). To build under Linux make sure you have the headers for libX11.

### Dependencies

You'll also need [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php) and [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html) if you want to be able to import and save images. 


## Getting started 

	tennis <- load.image(system.file('extdata/tennis_sif.mpeg',package='imager'))
	play(tennis)
	#now filter in the time direction and pipe to play
	deriche(tennis,10,axis="z") %>% play



## Documentation

At the moment you'll find

- a [tutorial](image_stats.html) on natural image statistics using imager
- another (incomplete) tutorial on [morphology and detrending](morphology.html)
- information on [accessing the CImg API using Rcpp](cpp_api.html)
- general package [documentation](imager.html)
- a [list of all functions](imager.pdf) with examples

You might find [CImg](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/)'s doc useful as well.
