title: "imager: an R package for image processing"

R is a bit lacking in the area of image processing, where Matlab is still king. Imager aims to make image processing work in R easier. It is based on [CImg](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/), a C++ library by David Tschumperlé. CImg provides an easy-to-use and consistent API for image processing, which imager largely replicates. CImg supports images in up to four dimensions, which makes it suitable for basic video processing/hyperspectral imaging as well. 

### Features

At this stage imager covers:

- loading and saving images in various formats
- displaying and plotting images
- working with pixel neighbourhoods 
- interpolation and resizing
- filtering and FFTs
- morphological operations 

### Documentation

At the moment you'll find

- a [tutorial](image_stats.html) on natural image statistics using imager
- another (incomplete) tutorial on [morphology and detrending](morphology.html)
- information on [accessing the CImg API using Rcpp](cpp_api.html)
- general package [documentation](imager.html)
- a [list of all functions](imager.pdf) with examples

You might find [CImg](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/)'s doc useful as well.
