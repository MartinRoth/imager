Imager is an image/video processing package for R, based on CImg, a C++ library by David Tschumperl√©. CImg provides an easy-to-use and consistent API for image processing, which imager largely replicates. CImg supports images in up to four dimensions, which makes it suitable for applications like video processing/hyperspectral imaging/MRI.

How to install:

So far the package is only available as source code, so you'll need a functional R build environment. 
You'll also need ImageMagick and ffmpeg somewhere on your path if you want to import and save images. 

Quick start:
Read the package vignette. 

Current status:

- Most CImg functions for filtering, morphology and colourspace conversions have R interfaces. The function calls and documentation is mostly verbatim copy from the original C++ API.
- There isn't a whole lot of argument checking so you might crash your session if you try something unexpected. Please report it if that happens.
- All images are stored as standard R numeric vectors (i.e., double-precision), meaning that they take up a lot of memory. On top of that there's some duplication going on in the back-and-forth between R and C++. Don't try to process 20 min. of video.
